# akka.parallel-map-reduce.java

####This is an implementation of a parallel map/reduce on top of Akka.


**Goal:** we want to calculate the number of map entries in the distributed hashmap storage where length of their keys equals the lengths of their values (i.e. key-A[length=4], val-A[length=4]).


- To start - execute Application.main() in IDE (or console).
